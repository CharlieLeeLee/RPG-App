# RPG-App
A Cross-System RPG character creation web app

Created by Charlie S. Norvell

I noticed that there are plenty of online character generation apps for individual systems, but not one that combines several
popular systems. A friend plans on GMing a campaign that uses several different systems, so I decided I wanted a place where I
could easily hold character sheets for all of them.

The current planned systems (in order of creation)*
  1. Dungeons & Dragons 5e
  2. Chronicles of Darkness (and each of its subcategories such as Changeling the Lost, Hunter the Vigil, etc.)
  3. Pathfinder
  4. Fantasy Age
  5. Pugmire (potentially, I need to look more into copyright stuff)
  6. Eclipse Phase
  7. Savage Worlds
  8. Shadowrun

* this order is subject to change depending on how complicated the systems get/how familiar I become with them from playing.
